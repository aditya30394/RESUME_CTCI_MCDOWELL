		\begin{cvsubsection}{Software Engineer, R\&D}{Sandvine Technologies}{June 2016 -- July 2018}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Automated parameter calibration in fuzzy control system by developing service using C++ capable of monitoring network traffic over \textbf{100,000 locations}.
				\item Designed REST APIs for traffic shapers in C++ enabling dynamic policy enforcements without system reloads. This saves \textbf{9 hours} (average) of maintenance time per month.
				\item Developed hash map and timers based internet traffic classification mechanism in C++ improving identification of applications that rely on third-party services by \textbf{90\%} (on average).
				\item Improved system reloads time by \textbf{10\%} using efficient data structures like maps/sets and removing file-based configuration reads. (C++)
