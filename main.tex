	\begin{cvsection}{EXPERIENCE}
	\begin{cvsubsection}{Software Development Intern}{Amazon Inc.}{June 2019 -- August 2019}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Developed and launched highly-scalable internal service \textbf{(1000 TPS)} based on service-oriented architecture (SOA) using various AWS technologies like DynamoDB, Lambda, S3, etc. (Java, Python, SQL, shell).
				\item Automated data migrations with distributed job scheduling and built a responsive single-page application (SPA) in React.js for the service which is used for analytics.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{cvsubsection}
		
		\begin{cvsubsection}{Software Engineer, R\&D}{Sandvine Technologies}{June 2016 -- July 2018}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Automated parameter calibration in fuzzy control system by developing service using C++ capable of monitoring network traffic over \textbf{100,000 locations}.
				\item Designed REST APIs for traffic shapers in C++ enabling dynamic policy enforcements without system reloads. This saves \textbf{9 hours} (average) of maintenance time per month.
				\item Developed hash map and timers based internet traffic classification mechanism in C++ improving identification of applications that rely on third-party services by \textbf{90\%} (on average).
				%\item Improved system reloads time by \textbf{10\%} using efficient data structures like maps/sets and removing file-based configuration reads. (C++)
