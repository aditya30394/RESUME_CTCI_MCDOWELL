	    \begin{cvsubsection}{Senior Software Engineer}{Microsoft Corporation}{June 2020 -- Present}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Contributed to the \href{https://github.com/features/codespaces/}{GitHub Codespaces} platform, which provides cloud-powered development environments, supporting over \textbf{250,000} daily creates and resumes globally. Collaborated with cross-functional teams to ensure platform stability and scalability.
                    \item Led the design and implementation of an automated pool scaling system, reducing operational costs by \textbf{\$3M} annually and achieving \textbf{99.9\%} service reliability through dynamic scaling and automated failovers.
                    \item Developed a queue-based notification callback system, enabling immediate resource allocation and significantly improving error detection and resolution with detailed failure reporting.
                    \item Led a cross-team initiative to optimize alerts and automate failovers, reducing \textbf{Time to Detect (TTD)} to under 5 minutes and achieving near-instant \textbf{Time to Mitigation (TTM)} through automated processes.
                    \item Spearheaded initiatives to optimize the Codespaces codebase, enforcing coding standards and improving CI pipeline integration, resulting in a \textbf{50\% reduction} in CI/CD runtime and enhancing code quality and developer productivity.
			\end{itemize}

	    \begin{cvsubsection}{Software Development Intern}{Amazon Inc.}{June 2019 -- August 2019}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Developed and launched highly-scalable internal service \textbf{(1000 TPS)} based on service-oriented architecture (SOA) using various AWS technologies like DynamoDB, Lambda, S3, etc. (Java, Python, SQL, shell).
				\item Automated data migrations with distributed job scheduling and built a responsive single-page application (SPA) in React.js for the service which is used for analytics.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{cvsubsection}
		
		\begin{cvsubsection}{Software Engineer, R\&D}{Sandvine Technologies}{June 2016 -- July 2018}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Automated parameter calibration in fuzzy control system by developing service using C++ capable of monitoring network traffic over \textbf{100,000 locations}.
				\item Designed REST APIs for traffic shapers in C++ enabling dynamic policy enforcements without system reloads. This saves \textbf{9 hours} (average) of maintenance time per month.
				\item Developed hash map and timers based internet traffic classification mechanism in C++ improving identification of applications that rely on third-party services by \textbf{90\%} (on average).
				%\item Improved system reloads time by \textbf{10\%} using efficient data structures like maps/sets and removing file-based configuration reads. (C++)
